#Summarize the project and what problem it was solving

The main goal of this project was to create a thermostat that was able to read the current temperature and display the temperature via led.  and also enable the ability to increase or decrease the temperature.

#What did you do particularly well?

I was unable to get my CCS board to comply.  Unfortunately I was not able to do any of the code to board assignments because of this issue.  I tried to read and understand what was being asked of the assignments as far as timers so that I would have an overall understanding of what the assignments were trying to explain.

#Where could you improve?

I could have improved on all aspects of this assignment.  I was unable to modify the CCS assigned files, so I could not demonstrate the led blinking.  It really sucks, but I did my best.

#What tools and /or resources are you adding to your support network?

Well, I have a better understanding of how to communicate with boards that will allow you to write to them.  The python code itself was interesting to say the least.  

#What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and / or course work?

MOre than likely anything that will focus on embedded systems.  I have a better understanding of the overall perspective of embedded systems going forward.

#How did you make this project maintainable, readable, adaptable?

I just tried to complete the jurnal assignments as best as I possibly could.  I still don't understand what error message I was getting, and I did try to reinstall the ccs software several times.  Nonetheless, I did what I could with what I had.
